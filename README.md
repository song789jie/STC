# Scalable Tactile Coding (STC)
We currently offer a demo for the PyTorch implementation of "Scalable Tactile Coding" along with pretrained weights. Detailed training procedures will be available soon.

# Demo: 
    python ./stc_demo.py

# Dataset:
For the dataset, please refer to [TUM dataset](https://cloud.lmt.ei.tum.de/s/pDEPZnGomQYtH4c).

We employed a 5-fold cross-validation approach, with each fold containing the files listed in ./cross_validation/fold_x.txt.

# Environment:

python 3.8

torch 2.0.1+cu118
