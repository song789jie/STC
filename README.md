# Scalable Tactile Coding (STC)
We currently offer a demo for the PyTorch implementation of "Scalable Tactile Coding" along with pretrained weights. Detailed training and evaluation procedures will be available soon.

# Demo: 
    python ./stc_demo.py

# Dataset:
For the dataset, please refer to [TUM dataset](https://cloud.lmt.ei.tum.de/s/pDEPZnGomQYtH4c).

# Environment:

python 3.8

torch 2.0.1+cu117

vector_quantize_pytorch 1.8.1

The FSQ (stands for Finite Scalar Quantization) relies on lucidrains' [repository](https://github.com/lucidrains/vector-quantize-pytorch).
